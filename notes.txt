@extend allows us to use the properties of one selector to other selectors. (See navbar.scss ln 11)

When compiled to css, the rules are bunched together like this:

    selector-1, selector-2{} where selector-2 inherits properties from selector-1


When we don't want a rule to be compiled to css, we can turn it into a placeholder rule by adding % next to the selector. For example %flex-layout{}
